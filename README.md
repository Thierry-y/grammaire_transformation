# Context-Free Grammar Transformer

This program converts any **context-free grammar (CFG)** into its corresponding **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)** and **Greibach Normal Form (GNF)**. Additionally, it allows users to generate words that can be produced by the grammar in any of the three forms: CFG, CNF, or GNF.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Storing the Grammar  
Store the algebraic grammars to be transformed in `cfg.general`.

### 2. Using `make`

- **`make` or `make run`**  
  Runs the `grammaire` program, generating the files:
  - `alg.chomsky` â€“ The grammar transformed into **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**.
  - `alg.greibach` â€“ The grammar transformed into **Greibach Normal Form (GNF)**.

- **`make diff`**  
  Uses the `generer` program to:  
  1. Read `alg.chomsky` and `alg.greibach`.  
  2. Generate test files `test_5_chomsky.res` and `test_5_greibach.res` (containing words of max length **5**).  
  3. Compare the `.res` files to check for differences.

### 3. Running Without `make`

- **Generate CNF and GNF files:**  
  ```
  python3 grammaire.py
  ```

- **Generate words using a transformed grammar:**  
  ```
  python3 generer.py alg.chomsky n
  python3 generer.py alg.greibach n
  ```
  Where `n` is the maximum length of words generated by the grammar.
